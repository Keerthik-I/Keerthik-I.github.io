<h1 dir="ltr">Welcome</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Hello, my name is Keerthik Iyer, and welcome to my personal website. I am a 22-year-old from North Carolina with aspirations in programming and data analysis. I&rsquo;ve been learning programming skills for nearly 5 years now, and much of that is broad skills over multiple different languages. This website will serve as an introduction to me and what I can do. The About Me page will be a more thorough introduction to who I am and how I came to be what I am today. The Skills page will an introduction to the skills that I have picked up through my years both in school, in the workplace, and on my own time. Finally, the Blog will be a place to see my most recent work and thoughts, in the form of short personal posts. Thanks for visiting and I hope you have a wonderful day.<br>
