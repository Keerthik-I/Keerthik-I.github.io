	<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Keerthik Iyer, and I have been working on entering the data analysis field for quite a while. I grew up in Wisconsin for the first 14 years of my life, moving to North Carolina at the start of high school. Living in Cary was a bit limiting at first, but going to high school at Raleigh Charter High School near downtown Raleigh gave me a good chance to get to know the city and the state as a whole. I quite enjoy the area, despite its predictably unpredictable weather(this makes sense if you have lived here) and humid summers. I currently live with my mother, father, and sister as well as my lovely dog Luna. 
    </p>
<p>I followed up on my time at Raleigh Charter High School by attending North Carolina State University. After bouncing between many unsatisfying majors at NCSU, facing a worldwide pandemic in Covid-19, and a separate major health crisis in my immediate family, I decided to reevaluate my professional path, return back to living with my family and dedicate my time to learning data science skills full time at Wake Tech. I am very excited to continue my education and enter the field itself. Data science has been a passion of mine for many years since I learned of the concept back in my senior year of high school. Since then, after studying some SAS, R, and Python mostly as a side to other educational topics, I am ready to commit to the subject fully.</p><br>
