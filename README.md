This is my GitHub account created during CTI 110. This repository was also created for CTI 110 for the purpose of creating a GitHub pages website to host my Portfolio Website. I created the repository online, cloned it to my desktop using the GitHub desktop app, copied my website files into the local repository,
then committed and pushed the branch to the online repository.
